# Stage 05 — Interface Contract (the seam)

The contract is whatever sits between your core and its consumer. For a web app that's
API endpoints (the table below). For a CLI it's commands + flags + output shapes; for a
plugin it's hooks + filters; for a pipeline it's input/output file schemas. Keep the
table's SPIRIT — every feature maps to an interface, every interface has its shapes
written before code — and adapt the columns to your project's shape.

Written BEFORE any code. Backend cards build TO this table; UI cards consume FROM it.
The #1 AI-build failure is producer/consumer drift — backend ships one shape, UI assumes
another, both look green. This file is the cheap fix.

## Gate — check ALL before `/flow next`
- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one INTERFACE below (web: endpoint · cli: command · library: public function · skill: command/file)
- [x] Every interface has its INPUT and OUTPUT shapes written (web: request+response · cli: flags+output/exit code · library: args+return)
- [x] Access/effects column filled for every interface (web: public/token/admin · non-web: writes/side-effects, or "none")
- [x] No FILL placeholders remain in this file

## OpenAPI / Swagger rule  (web only — N/A for cli/library/skill)

For non-web types there is no served spec; the equivalent "no producer/consumer drift" check
is the per-type done-evidence (the command runs / the API imports / the skill installs+runs).
For `web`:

This table is the PLANNING source of truth. If the framework serves a spec (FastAPI →
`/openapi.json` + `/docs`), the served spec is the RUNTIME artifact of this same contract:
- Path/method/shapes here and in the served spec must agree — the contract-test card
  asserts every endpoint in this table exists in the live `/openapi.json` with matching
  request/response shapes.
- Change flows ONE way: amend this file first, then the code, then the spec follows.
- **Docs land with the API, not after**: the served spec is live from the vertical-slice
  card onward, and every backend card's verify checks its endpoints appear in the live
  `/docs` with correct schemas. The contract-test card later asserts full agreement —
  but by then the docs have been growing card by card, never a catch-up task.
- Keep `/docs` enabled at least until v1 ships — it's the free human-readable contract.

## Interfaces  (web: endpoints · cli: commands · library: functions · skill: commands)

Adapt the columns to your project type. Web: Method/Path/Access(=auth: public/token/admin)/
Request/Response. CLI: Command/Flags/Access(=side-effects)/Input/Output+exit. Library:
Function/—/Access(=none)/Args/Return. The shared column below is "Access/Effects".

| Method/Interface | Path/Name | Access/Effects | Input shape | Output shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Component (UI) | `LoginGate` | Render children if auth passes, else render Login Page | `appTitle: string`, `children: ReactNode` | ReactNode |
| tRPC Mutation | `auth.login` | Public (Set cookie on success) | `{ email, password }` | `void` |
| tRPC Query | `auth.me` | Token / Session cookie | `void` | `Me = { id, email, name, role, ... } \| null` |
| HTTP Redirect | `${API_URL}/auth/sso/login` | Public (SSO flow initiation) | `void` | Redirects to Microsoft login page |

## Shared shapes (objects used by multiple interfaces)

```typescript
type Me = {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'super_admin' | 'facility_admin' | 'staff' | 'teacher';
  facilityId?: string;
  // ...other fields as defined by the backend
};
```

## Feature → interface map

Reference each PRD feature by its `FRn` id so the mapping is machine-checkable
(`/flow consistency` flags any `FRn` with no interface here).

- FR1 → `LoginGate` component (Cải tiến tiêu đề login).
- FR2 → `LoginGate` component (Background gradient và Glassmorphism).
- FR3 → `LoginGate` component (Tối ưu hóa spacing và kích thước các nút bấm trên mobile).
